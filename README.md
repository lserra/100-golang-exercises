## 🎯 About This Project

These challenges are adapted from a file called "100+ Python challenging programming exercises" that I found on the internet. I decided to rewrite all exercises in Golang as I am very interested in learning to program in this amazing programming language. 🚀

I will update this file as I rewrite the solutions from Python to Golang. Each solution is placed in its own folder so it can be run locally. Smaller single-file solutions can also be run in the [Golang Playground](https://play.golang.org). ⚡

## 📚 Exercise Categories

The exercises are organized into three difficulty levels:

- **🟢 Beginner**: [exercises_beginner.md](exercises_beginner.md)
- **🟡 Intermediate**: [exercises_intermediate.md](exercises_intermediate.md)
- **🔴 Advanced**: [exercises_advanced.md](exercises_advanced.md)

## 📖 Level Descriptions

### 🟢 Level 1: Beginner

Beginner means someone who has just completed an introductory Golang course. They can solve problems using 1 or 2 Golang classes or functions. Normally, the answers can be directly found in textbooks.

### 🟡 Level 2: Intermediate

Intermediate means someone who has just learned Golang but already has a relatively strong programming background. They should be able to solve problems that may involve 3 or more Golang classes or functions. The answers cannot be directly found in textbooks.

### 🔴 Level 3: Advanced

Advanced means you should use Golang to solve more complex problems using richer library functions, data structures, and algorithms. You are expected to use several Golang standard packages and advanced techniques.

## ⚠️ Note

This repository is complete. I'm still learning Go myself, and there are still some bugs here and there. If you find one, please let me know—pull requests are gladly welcome! 🙏

**Thanks!** ❤️
